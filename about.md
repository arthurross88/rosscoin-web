We started this project back in 2017, when the cryto hype was booming, but we decided to wait until this hype was over in order to become a stable coin. For we believe that Zambia is worth all our efforts, especially when it comes to sport. 
Still it is incredibly important to fight the corruption and poaching in Zambia, therefore we are planning on making an agreement with its surrounding countries.
