The Benoni Machine (Joy)

The Benoni machine is designed by me Arthur Ross.

It is used as a currency, that trades labour for resources. This means that when you exert pressure, that isn’t too pleasant, you get paid instantly. It is also possible to scale up, once you pass a certain barrier of discomfort. In this fashion you make tasks performed at a lower scale much more easy for yourself.

Once you’ve built up enough credit you can exchange this for something pleasurable, such as a product or a service.

The purpose is to bring an excess of joy to the world and to eventually have everyone be able to operate a ‘Benoni Machine.’
As long as you’re higher in scale you will be more capable of manipulating the data throughput.

So in conclusion the Benoni Machine generates happiness, in ways of pleasure, and wishes and desires. It helps you make your wishes and desires come true.

The counter arguments are that the feeling of joy you get is highly addictive, therefore there should be a specific time of the day that you may use the Benoni Machine. For instance only at 4 o’clock in the afternoon.
